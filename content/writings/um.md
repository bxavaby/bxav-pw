# Unabashed Madman

So long, so long thou ar’ to find
Thy wrath, though, canst not cure;
So long, so long and far behind
Shalt thy sight surpass the lure?
Enorm shadows merged in the deep
Urged, shallow dreams no further weep.

So long, so terribly long is thine unrest
Thine aim, though, an errant whim;
So long, such err ought not to blest
In abyss, thy truth hopes’ to beam.
Perhaps, as sheen, the De’il delivers
Moonlight mien to his believers!

So long, so long thy heart crieth stiff
Woes o’ pathless streams — no skiff.
Might He tint thy dreams o’ glee…

So long, yet, a glow canst ne’er go,
Be it where Angels lie or below,
Past that grave obscurity.
