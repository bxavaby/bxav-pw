# ‘Twixt mountains, more than two — Villanelle Variation

‘Twixt mountains, more than two
Goeth an utterance free an’ calm,
Goeth a play of silhouettes blue.

A play of paling silhouettes blue
Otherworldly be their inert charm
Lieth faith in them hushing new!

‘Twixt mountains, more than two
Maketh the De’il his moony balm,
To save those sore o’ sterile woe.

A play of abyssal silhouettes blue
Aye, in vain, falleth icy an’ warm
‘Tis all Life or none, e’er worn anew.

‘Twixt mountains, more than two
Goeth aloft a fading fleet – in psalm –,
Goeth th’ oblivion of an unseen view.

Thence a bird tumultuously flew
An’ savored omens held the realm
‘Twixt mountains, more than two,
Gone, a play of silhouettes blue.
