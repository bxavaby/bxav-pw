# Les Effar√©s (Kids in a Daze)

Black against the fog and snow,
Against a grating all aglow,
Their asses spread,

Five kids-poor things!-squat and shake,
To watch a happy Baker bake
Hot golden bread.

They watch his white arms beat
The dough, and feel the heat
Of the bright stoves.

They hear the Baker softly hum
And hear a crackling sound come
From the baking loaves.

They are transfixed; they do not dare
Disturb the fragrant glowing air,
Warm as a mother's breast.

For a rich man's holiday he bakes
Golden rolls and pies and cakes-
A sugary feast!

And then beneath the smoky roof
They hear a song from a savory loaf
-Just like a bird!

The warm window steams and glows,
And they squat in their ragged clothes,
Their senses blurred-

They even think that they're rich, too-
Poor Baby Jesuses in a row
As the snow falls;

They stick their little noses in
Through the grating, moaning something
Through the holes

In a daze, saying prayers
And bending toward the lights
Of paradise,

So hard they split their pants,
And their shirttails dance
In a wind like ice.
